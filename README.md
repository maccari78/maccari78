Fullstack developer with experience in JavaScript, TypeScript, React, NestJS, PostgreSQL and TypeORM. Passionate about the backend, especially security
accounts (JWT, RBAC, bcrypt, passport, OAuth2) and constantly learning. Look for opportunities to contribute my skills in innovative projects and continue
growing professionally.
